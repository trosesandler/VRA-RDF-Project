VRA-RDF-Project
===============
This project was intiated by members of the VRA Core Oversight Committee.  The goal of the project is to develop an RDF Ontology for the VRA Core 4 data model.  We have developed a draft ontology and have created an XSLT stylesheet that can convert existing VRA Core 4 compliant XML data into RDF/XML.  Please try out the stylesheet and review the ontology.  Your feedback will help us refine both the stylesheet as well as the ontology.
